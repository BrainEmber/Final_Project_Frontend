I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Angular to construct the frontend.  For the backend api I used rails and JWT to send and receive authenticated JSON data.

I started the project as a way for gamers to connect and play together but soon realized that I had to split my data.  I chose to split my user-base into Male and Female.  This was so that I would have two working models and so that their could be interaction between those models. I used JWT to authenticate users and their interactions with the database.  My biggest struggles were implementing the JWT as it was my first experience using users and authentication.  

If I had more time I would have liked to introduce a third model for a non gendered option.  I also would have liked to clean up the login/create menu to make it a bit more user friendly.
